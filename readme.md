My personal advent of code repository. Launched in 2025, I intend to do a few 2024 puzzles to get the right flavor of things, and then move over to 2025 when it launches.

To help keep the format of the repository consistent and readable, `new_puzzle.sh` is run to create a skeleton directory for each puzzle.
